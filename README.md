This is a Auto Driving Simulator written in Java. The frameworks used in this are Maven and Java

Please ensure your IDE has access to a maven Framework and JAVA 18 available. 

No Special Configurations are needed to run this programme. 

Assumptions made:
1. Made the assumption, that it is possible for two cars to be placed in the same grid square and no collision will take place
2. Running a simulation without any input will throw an error.
3. If the car is placed in the grid that is out of bounds, exception should be thrown. 


Some Areas of Improvements that I came across in the form of exceptions:

1. Warn the user when they are putting two cars in the same grid square.
2. Error should be thrown when running a simulation without any input
